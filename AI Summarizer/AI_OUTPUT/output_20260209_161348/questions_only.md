### AI Suggested Questions

- Q3.1 What specific advantages does the Extended Power Range (EPR) offer over the previous PD and EPR models?
- Q3.2 _Why are voltage levels such as 28V, 36V, and 48V being introduced in EPR?_
- Q3.3 _Could you elaborate on how AVS (Adjustable Voltage Supply) differs from PPS in EPR mode entry/exit handshakes?_
- Q3.4 What additional safety constraints are implemented for cables in PD 3.1?
- Q3.5 _Which fault classes will be specifically handled by the EPR module?_
- Q3.6 How can agents immediately identify if an EPR negotiation should not have happened based on the `epr_capabilities` declaration?
- Q3.7 Could you provide a more detailed explanation of the new `epr_messages`, `epr_vbus_profile`, and `epr_timing` entries in the electrical_trace and timing_profile schemas?
- Q3.8 _What are the implications of having strict cable requirements (50V / 5A) for PD 3.1?_
- Q3.9 How does e-marker certification affect EPR compliance, as mentioned in the topology cable extensions section?
- Q3.10 _Could you give an example of a scenario where the agent rule 'EPR = 5A + 50V + e-marker' might fail and what that would mean in terms of system operation?_
