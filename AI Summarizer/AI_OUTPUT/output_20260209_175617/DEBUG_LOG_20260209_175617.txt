Why synthetic simulation is uniquely suited to find gaps\nReal hardware testing:\n* Shows _one_ implementation at a time\n* Is biased by vendor design choices\n* Rarely explores boundary simultaneity\n\nSynthetic simulation:\n* Explores **all legal interpretations** of the spec\n* Forces edge concurrency\n* Separates _spec intent_ from _implementation habit_\n\nKey idea:\n> **You don’t simulate devices — you simulate interpretations of the spec.**\n", "\n\n## 3.
