# Question 9

## User Question

real PR_SWAP/DR_SWAP ambiguity example as a mock spec gap

* * *

## Assistant Answer

Perfect. Let’s do this **concretely and surgically** — a **realistic PR_SWAP / DR_SWAP ambiguity** that _could_ exist even when everyone claims spec compliance.

I’ll present it like a **mock spec gap case** you could actually take to a standards discussion.

* * *

## 1. Scenario setup (minimal, realistic)

**Topology**

* DRP_A ↔ DRP_B
    
* eMarker cable present
    
* PD 3.x compliant stacks
    
* No vendor bugs assumed
    

**Initial state**

* DRP_A = Source + DFP
    
* DRP_B = Sink + UFP
    

Both DRPs are allowed (by spec) to:

* Initiate **PR_SWAP**
    
* Initiate **DR_SWAP**
    

This is important: **both swaps are legal and orthogonal** in the spec.

* * *

## 2. What the spec clearly defines

The spec clearly defines:

* Message formats
    
* Swap request/accept semantics
    
* Electrical transitions after PR_SWAP
    
* Data role changes after DR_SWAP
    

What it does **not clearly define**:

* Mutual exclusion rules between PR_SWAP and DR_SWAP
    
* Arbitration priority if both are initiated close together
    
* Explicit “quiet ownership” windows for DRP↔DRP during overlapping swaps
    

This is where ambiguity lives.

* * *

## 3. Two valid interpretations (both spec-compliant)

### Interpretation A (Conservative DRP)

> “Once a PR_SWAP is in progress, no other role swap should be initiated until power settles.”

So DRP_A behavior:

1. Initiates PR_SWAP
    
2. Suppresses DR_SWAP triggers
    
3. Expects partner silence except ACCEPT / PS_RDY
    

This is **reasonable** and commonly implemented.

* * *

### Interpretation B (Orthogonal DRP)

> “PR_SWAP and DR_SWAP are independent state machines.”

So DRP_B behavior:

1. Receives PR_SWAP
    
2. ACCEPTs PR_SWAP
    
3. Immediately initiates DR_SWAP (allowed by text, not explicitly forbidden)
    
4. Expects DR_SWAP handling in parallel
    

This is also **technically spec-compliant**.

👉 **Nothing in the spec explicitly forbids this.**

* * *

## 4. Timeline showing the ambiguity

Let’s put real timing to it.

```
t0   DRP_A → PR_SWAP
t1   DRP_B → ACCEPT
t2   DRP_B → DR_SWAP
t3   DRP_A → PS_RDY
```

Now the problem:

* DRP_A believes:
    
    * It owns the bus during PR_SWAP power transition
        
* DRP_B believes:
    
    * DR_SWAP is independent and allowed after ACCEPT
        

Both transmit SOP messages in overlapping windows.

* * *

## 5. Observable failure (deterministic)

What you see on the wire:

* CRC errors
    
* Missed PS_RDY
    
* DR_SWAP ignored or half-applied
    
* Sometimes Hard Reset
    

Important:

* No electrical violation
    
* No timing limit exceeded
    
* No malformed messages
    

This is **not noise** — it’s arbitration ambiguity.

* * *

## 6. Why this is a true spec gap (not an implementation bug)

To call this a spec gap, you must prove:

### 1️⃣ Both behaviors are allowed

* PR_SWAP rules don’t explicitly block DR_SWAP
    
* DR_SWAP rules don’t reference PR_SWAP exclusion
    

### 2️⃣ Failure occurs only when interacting

* Each DRP works fine with “similar” implementations
    
* Failure occurs only when interpretations differ
    

### 3️⃣ Spec gives no priority rule

* No “PR_SWAP dominates DR_SWAP” rule
    
* No mandatory serialization requirement
    

This satisfies the definition of a **spec ambiguity**.

* * *

## 7. How synthetic simulation exposes this (key insight)

Your synthetic generator creates:

* DRP_A with rule:
    
    ```
    forbid(DR_SWAP) during PR_SWAP
    ```
    
* DRP_B with rule:
    
    ```
    allow(DR_SWAP) after ACCEPT
    ```
    

Both rule sets pass individual spec checks.

When simulated together:

* Collision probability → 100%
    
* Failure deterministic
    
* Repeatable across seeds
    

That’s **hard proof**.

* * *

## 8. Why real hardware testing often misses this

Because:

* Vendors tend to test against similar stacks
    
* Lab setups rarely mix aggressive + conservative interpretations
    
* Engineers avoid overlapping swaps instinctively
    

Synthetic simulation **forces the overlap**.

* * *

## 9. Minimal counterexample (what standards groups love)

You can shrink this to:

* One PR_SWAP
    
* One DR_SWAP
    
* No cable quirks
    
* No EPR
    
* No retries
    

Just this sequence:

```
PR_SWAP → ACCEPT → DR_SWAP → PS_RDY
```

And show:

* Two legal interpretations
    
* One unavoidable collision
    

This is the _smallest failing system_.

* * *

## 10. Example proposed clarification (not redesign)

A **good** spec fix would be tiny, like:

> “While a PR_SWAP is in progress (from PR_SWAP request until completion of PS_RDY), the port shall not initiate a DR_SWAP.”

or alternatively:

> “If a DR_SWAP request is received during a PR_SWAP, it shall be deferred until completion of the PR_SWAP.”

You then simulate again and show:

* All interpretations converge
    
* No new failures introduced
    

* * *

## 11. Why this matters more with eMarker cables

Add eMarker traffic:

* SOP’ responses
    
* Cable latency
    
* Extra arbitration pressure
    

The ambiguity becomes **more likely**, not less.

So this gap scales with:

* DRP↔DRP
    
* EPR
    
* Advanced cables
    

* * *

## 12. How you’d present this to USB Implementers Forum

Not as:

> “We saw a bug”

But as:

> “The current spec permits two valid behaviors that fail when combined. Here is the minimal scenario and a clarifying constraint that resolves it.”

That’s a **standards-quality argument**.

* * *

### My opinion

This PR_SWAP / DR_SWAP overlap is a _classic mature-spec gap_: rare, subtle, and invisible until ecosystems diversify. Synthetic simulation turns these from “heisenbugs” into **provable ambiguities**. That’s exactly how strong specs evolve — not by tightening everything, but by closing the few gaps that actually break interoperability.

If you want next, I can:

* Turn this into a **formal DSL gap report**
    
* Draft a **mock USB-IF ECN-style change note**
    
* Show how to **auto-detect similar gaps**
    
* Or expand this to **EPR + swap interactions**
