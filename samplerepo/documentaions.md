## 1. Git

### What is Git?

Git is a **distributed version control system** used to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work together on non-linear development histories efficiently.

### Key Concepts

- **Repository (Repo)**: A storage space where your project lives. It can be local (on your computer) or remote (on a server like GitHub).
- **Commit**: A snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. It saves your changes.
- **Branch**: A parallel version of a repository. It allows you to work freely without affecting the main codebase.
- **Merge**: Taking the changes from one branch and integrating them into another.
- **Staging Area (Index)**: A middle ground where you prepare files before committing them.
