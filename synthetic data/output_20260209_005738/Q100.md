Map DSL rules to USB-IF test cases

## Assistant Answer

Great question — this is the step that turns the DSL from an _internal engineering tool_ into something **certification-aware and audit-friendly**.

I’ll explain this in four layers:

1. Mapping philosophy
    
2. Mapping model (how one DSL rule links to USB-IF tests)
    
3. Concrete examples (SPR + EPR)
    
4. How this helps agents, validation, and certification workflows
