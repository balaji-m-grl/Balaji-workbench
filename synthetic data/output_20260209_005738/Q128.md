How to find gaps in the pd spec using synthetic data simulation and make chage proposal for spec

## Assistant Answer

This is a **very mature question** — it goes beyond “using the spec” into **improving the spec itself**. I’ll answer this as an engineering + standards-process problem, not an academic one.

I’ll break it into **how gaps emerge**, **how synthetic simulation exposes them**, and **how to convert that into a credible change proposal**.
