Design an EPR scenario generator

## Assistant Answer

Nice, this is the **engine room** of the whole system. I’ll design the EPR scenario generator like something you could actually hand to an engineer and start implementing in C++ / Python tomorrow.

I’ll keep it **architectural first**, then go into **algorithmic flow**, **scenario types**, and **control knobs**.
