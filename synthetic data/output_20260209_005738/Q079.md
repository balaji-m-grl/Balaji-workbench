spec-rule DSL

## Assistant Answer

Nice choice. A **spec-rule DSL** is the right abstraction layer here — it separates _USB-PD knowledge_ from _code_ and from _models_. I’ll design this as something:

* Domain engineers can read & review
    
* Machines can evaluate deterministically
    
* Agents can reason _with_, not just _over_
    

I’ll keep it **clean, declarative, and evolvable**.
