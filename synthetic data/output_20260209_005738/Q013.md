Explain with USB pd domain agent model training example

## Assistant Answer

Synthetic data, in model training, is **artificially generated data that mimics real-world data**—its structure, patterns, edge cases, and constraints—without being directly collected from real systems or users.

It’s not random data. Good synthetic data is **domain-faithful**, **statistically realistic**, and **behaviorally meaningful** for the task the model is learning.
