How to connect synthetic data fir real time scenario like having 2 drp connected with emarker cable and communication flow during pr swap and drswap and possible pkt collision if any one drp or eMarker design don't align with spec

## Assistant Answer

Great question. This is exactly where **synthetic data stops being “offline ML stuff” and becomes a live engineering tool**.

I’ll explain this in a **real-time–connected way**, using your exact case:

> **Two DRPs connected via an e-marker cable, PR_SWAP + DR_SWAP flows, and packet collisions when one component is spec-misaligned.**

I’ll structure this in layers so it maps cleanly to your C++ streamer + .NET analyzer + agent stack.
